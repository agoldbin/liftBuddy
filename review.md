|Item |Considerations| Comments/Suggestions|
|--------|---------|---|
|||Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement|
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| |
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens |  |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| Currently no database or DAOs set up |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.| No tests written yet. JSPs appears to be well written with no redundant code that could be split into a separate JSP file. No comments in java classes currently, but classes appear to be small and single purposed. |

|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| Program flow seems to make sense, project plan is clear and explains the technologies that will be used to solve the problem. |
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | Yup, everything here makes sense. Form fields are in a good order, data makes sense and includes comments. |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| Database is simple at this point but meets the requirements and works to solve the solution. |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.| Classes are a good, maintainable size. Tests appear to work well. Log statements used instead of sys.out. JSPs appear simple at this point, but currently do not contain redundant code. Good work so far. |

|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| Problem statement is well thought out and clearly defines the project goal. |
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | Program flow and site design is logical and makes sense. Documentation seems to be up to date. |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| Everything appears good. Just missing a generic dao if wanted. |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4.

Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.| Classes appear proper sized, JSPs are currently simple and do not have any repetitive code. Log statements used. Tests for daos used. |
