DISCLAIMER: All times are estimates as I am bad at actually tracking when I work on the project and materials.

Week 1: ~8 hrs?
    All I know is it was a total pain and took a lot longer for me to figure out than it rightfully should have.
Week 2: = 4.5 hrs
Week 3: = 6.5 hrs
Week 4: = 5.5 hrs

Running total: = 28 hrs
