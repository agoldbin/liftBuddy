# Time Log for Aaron Goldbin

DISCLAIMER: All times are estimates as I am bad at actually tracking when I work on the project and materials.

| Date | Activity | Time | Notes |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| Week 1 | All | ~8 hrs? | All I know is it was a total pain and took a lot longer for me to figure out than it rightfully should have.|
| Week 2 | All | 4.5 hrs | |
| Week 3 | All | 6.5 hrs | |
| Week 4 | All | 5.5 hrs | |
| 2/11/18 | Dao/Test DB setup | 2 hrs | |
| 2/12/18 | More Dao and DaoTest Setup|  | Ran into an issue with MySql. Realized I was only able to log in as root and spent time trying to resolve issue. So far, nada. |
