Project Problem Statement

Finding someone to workout with can be a challenge. Even if you currently go to 
a gym, you may rarely speak to other members as neither person wants to 
interrupt the others workout. But what if there was a way to find someone in
your area with similar workout goals and routines as you? Someone to help keep
you motivated to push for that extra rep, to give you a spot without having to
awkwardly get another patrons attention?



Project Solution

The goal of Lift Buddy (working name) is to allow users to sign up and
seach for users in their area by a few criteria. Users who are currently 
members of a gym can search for others who use the same gym. Or if a user
doesn't have a current gym membership, or is willing to get a new membership, 
they can search for any users in the area. The goal of the site will be to
find people with similar goals, routines, or exercise interests, and who are
at a similar level as far as strength/cardio. Additionally, if time permits, 
users will be able to track their workouts so they can see their progression
towards their goals.
